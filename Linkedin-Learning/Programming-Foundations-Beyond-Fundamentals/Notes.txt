Hi
# working with strings:
    #print("The distance in kilometer is " * 5) the distance in kilometer is repeated 5 times
    #print("The distance in kilometer is " + 5) its a type error, but in JS it will convert the number into string so it will be the distance is 5


# choosing a code style:
    Style guides (Documentation on approaches to code):
    online style guides like (python style guide, python enhancement proposal, google python style guide)
    The most commonly used style guide is PEP8 (Python Enhancement Proposal Number 8)
    * Indentation to indicate the content structure
    Ex: Aligned with opening delimiter
    foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two
                            var_three, var_four)

    Pseudocode:
    It is recommended to write pseudocode before digging right into the code to help you create a basic outline for the program
# Debugging

    types of error:
    Syntax Error, Runtime error, semantics(logic) Error

    IDE (AutoRecommendation, Style Highlight, Linting(check code for bugs before even executed),....)


    Test cases (Commands or scripts designed to a specific scenario:

#Object oriented

    What is the object-oriented programming term for something that an object can do?
    a method

    Why aren't all possible methods made available to every object?
    to avoid overloading computer memory with unneeded methods
    If all objects had access to all methods in the language, your programs would need more computer memory.

# Advanced
    computers uses  Drive, Memory(ROM, RAM)
    Memory Management(some languages allow programmers to write a code that decides what's kept in memory and what's thrown away):
    Many languages support an alternative approach to memory management known as garbage collection (An automated process that keeps track of which items aren't needed and deletes them


    Multithreading (Pipelining) to do more than one thing at a time

    (ملحوظة لو مهتم اكثر راجع كورس ال operating systems)

    python support multithreading
    JS  support asynchronous code it isn't exactly the same of multithreading but it's very similar

    Algorithms

    What is it called when a compiler keeps track of which items in memory are no longer needed and deletes them automatically?
    garbage collection

    What's an advantage of using multithreading?
    It can make your computer programs faster and more responsive.
    Structuring your code to do multiple things at once can increase a program's speed and responsiveness.

    Which is the best description of what an algorithm is?
    a set of instructions that describes how to get the exact result you want
